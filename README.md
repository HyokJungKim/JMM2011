This repository presents the C++ version of [Judd, Maliar, and Maliar (2011, QE)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/QE14). The original paper had the Matlab version of the code. The numerical integration technique suggested in the paper is very useful, and the accompanying code is also nice. However, researchers who need the utmost performance in C++ would find this package useful.

In this repository, you will find functions to generate integration nodes and weights using [1] Gauss-Hermite quadrature, and [2] two Monomial integration algorithm presented in Judd, Maliar, and Maliar (2011, QE).
