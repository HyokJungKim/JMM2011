# JMM2011
This repository presents the C++ version of [Judd, Maliar, and Maliar (2011, QE)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/QE14). The original paper had the Matlab version of the code. The numerical integration technique suggested in the paper is very useful, and their accompanying Matlab codes are also very useful. This repository can be useful for researchers who want to use JMM (2001) method in C++ for utmost performance.

In this repository, you will find functions to generate integration nodes and weights using [1] Gauss-Hermite quadrature, and [2] two Monomial integration algorithms presented in Judd, Maliar, and Maliar (2011, QE).
